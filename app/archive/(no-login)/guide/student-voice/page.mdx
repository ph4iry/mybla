# Student Voice in myBLA
With electives at BLA often being an area of unknown for prospective AP students, student voice and transparency has become a pillar of the development of myBLA. In fact, this very website is [open-source](https://github.com/ph4iry/mybla). The solution to this very confusion and speculation about the experience of [taking AP courses](/guide/ap-courses) is the <span className="font-bold">Student Voice section</span>, sharing to underclassmen the climate of electives offered at BLA.

Here's a crash course to how the section works:
1. High school students at BLA submit recommendations and "reviews" (more like polls) relating to courses that they can choose to report on.
2. These responses are showcased as stats of multiple factors:

## Important Academic and Personal Skills (referred to as the Skills Summary)
The Skills Summary asks students to determine: *What skills would a student need to succeed in this course?*

These are separated into three subject areas: <span className="text-amber-400">Humanities (English or History class skills)</span>, <span className="text-emerald-400">STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math skills)</span>, and <span className="text-blue-400">Personal skills (like patience or resourcefulness)</span>. The number shown after a skill in the summary is stating how many respondents have agreed to saying that *"This skill is important for a student to succeed in this class."*

### Example <span className="text-amber-400">Humanities</span> Skills
<ul className="grid md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-1">
  <li>General reading skills</li>
  <li>General writing skills</li>
  <li>Researching</li>
  <li>Synthesizing text content</li>
  <li>Essay writing</li>
  <li>Narrative writing</li>
</ul>

### Example <span className="text-emerald-400">STEM</span> Skills
<ul className="grid md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-1">
  <li>Basic arithmetic (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division)</li>
  <li>General understanding of Algebra 1 and 2 (like exponentiation and roots)</li>
  <li>Strong trigonometry skills</li>
  <li>General technology skills (like being able to operate a computer)</li>
  <li>Strong biology skills (with proof such as a high-performing score in Biology 1 or equivalent)</li>
  <li>Strong chemistry skills (with proof such as a high-performing grade in Chemistry 1 or equivalent)</li>
</ul>

### Example <span className="text-blue-400">Personal</span> Skills
<ul className="grid md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-1">
  <li>Communication and cooperation (such as frequent group work)</li>
  <li>Oral presentation and public speaking</li>
  <li>Work ethic</li>
  <li>Time management</li>
  <li>Resourcefulness (being able to use resources such as the internet efficiently to acquire information)</li>
  <li>Patience</li>
</ul>

{/* ## Weekly and Nightly Time Commitments
These ratings are shown under individual submissions with the icons <HiOutlineClock className="inline h-6 text-rose-400"/> for weekly commitment and <HiOutlineInboxArrowDown className="inline h-6 text-fuchsia-400"/> for nightly homework.

While similar, <span className="text-rose-400 font-bold">Weekly Commitment</span> covers the class as a whole, including labs, lab reports, projects, homework, and field trips (or other activities) happening in an average week of the school year. Some classes have more opportunities during the month than others and may consequently have a higher weekly commitment.

On the other hand, <span className="text-fuchsia-400 font-bold">Nightly Commitment</span> solely focuses on nightly homework. This quantity refers to the amount of hours of nightly homework this class tends to give, ranging from below 30 minutes to over 3 hours nightly.

## Available Online Resources
The third rating shown under individual student submissions is symbolized with the icon <HiOutlineCursorArrowRays className="inline h-6 text-blue-400"/> for <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">Available Online Resources</span>. This will be fleshed out in the near future, but currently describes the **amount** of online resources available for this class. This includes access to videos and other course materials as supplements to participating in the class. */}
