# Shareables
One of the many features of myBLA are **shareables**. Shareables are self-explanatory in that they are data that you can share with your peers or counselor when considering courses you want to take. There are two types of shareables currently available: course selections (myBLA links) and a PDF export. Both of these are accessed from the [Catalog Favorites](/catalog/favorites) page, where courses that you've hearted (<HiStar className="h-4 text-rose-400 inline" />) can be shown as a shortcut.

## Creating a Course Selection (myBLA Link)
To create a course selection:
1. Click the <span class="text-amber-400">Create Course Selection</span> button above your listed favorites.
2. Using the circles that appear upon clicking the button, select courses you want to share as a group.
3. Create a link by clicking the Share (<HiOutlineShare className="h-5 text-zinc-400 inline m-0" />) button and (optionally) name your selection.
4. Click <span class="text-white font-medium">Copy Link</span>!

## Export as a PDF document
To export a selection as a document:
1. Click the <span class="text-amber-400">Create Course Selection</span> button above your listed favorites.
2. Using the circles that appear upon clicking the button, select courses you want to share as a group.
3. Create a PDF by clicking the Export as PDF (<HiOutlineDocumentArrowDown className="h-5 text-zinc-400 inline m-0" />) button and fill in the details in the dialog prompt: student name, 6-digit ID, and the first part of your school email (this is *just* the first part of your email because **myBLA adds on the "@bostonk12.org" for you!**).
4. Click <span class="text-blue-300 font-medium">Download</span> and get your PDF!
