# Arts Electives at BLA
All high school students in Massachusetts now need [1 art credit in order to graduate](https://www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/graduation.html#:~:text=one%20year%20of%20an%20arts%20program%3B). Here's what this means and how to factor it into your course selections:

  ### Half-Credit Courses
  [High School Band](/catalog/898) and [High School Orchestra](/catalog/89D) are worth a *half credit*. Two years of these courses are required to meet the requirement. They aren't calcuated in your GPA on Aspen or in your transcript, but colleges will still weigh these classes into your GPA as half of a class. For example, if you took 6 core classes and Band as an elective, colleges recalculating your GPA will consider your course load as 6.5 classes.
